# Introduction
This demo shows the functional way of using Spring WebFlux to work with CommerceTools java SDK. This way we can use non-blocking SDK calls that return CompletableFuture and make use of reactive programming to build efficient APIs on top of CommerceTools. 

# Getting Started

Run the standard spring boot commands to run this project

``
gradle build && gradle bootRun
``
